## üìπ How I Created the Video (Free)

I used [InVideo](https://invideo.io/) to create the video for this project. Here are the simple steps I followed:  

1. **Sign Up**  
   - Go to [https://invideo.io/](https://invideo.io/) and create a free account.  

2. **Choose a Template**  
   - After logging in, click on **Templates** and select a free video template that fits your topic.  

3. **Customize the Video**  
   - Add your own text, images, or videos.  
   - Change fonts, colors, and animations using the easy drag-and-drop editor.  

4. **Add Music & Voiceover (Optional)**  
   - Choose background music from the free library or upload your own.  
   - You can also add a voiceover directly from the editor.  

5. **Export the Video for Free**  
   - Click **Export** and select the free plan (it will add a small watermark).  
   - Download the video once it‚Äôs rendered.

3. **Generate Slides Automatically**  
   - Paste your text into the input box and let SlidesAI generate professional slides for you.  

4. **Customize the Slides**  
   - Change slide themes, fonts, and colors to make it look better.  
   - Add images or icons if needed.  

5. **Download or Export**
